## 1. Introduction to Web-Based Attacks {#introduction}

### 1.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a critical web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

#### Types of XSS Attacks:

**1. Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent)**
- Malicious script is embedded in a URL and executed when the victim clicks the link
- Example: `https://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

**2. Stored XSS (Persistent)**
- Malicious script is permanently stored on the target server
- Executes every time users access the infected page

**3. DOM-based XSS**
- Occurs when client-side JavaScript modifies the DOM environment
- The attack payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM environment

#### Common XSS Payloads:
```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
javascript:alert('XSS')
<iframe src="javascript:alert('XSS')"></iframe>
<svg onload=alert('XSS')>
```

### 1.2 SQL Injection (SQLi) Attacks

SQL Injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's database layer by manipulating SQL queries.

#### Types of SQL Injection:

**1. Union-Based SQL Injection**
- Uses UNION operator to combine results from multiple SELECT statements
- Example: `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

**2. Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection**
- Relies on sending SQL queries that force different application responses
- Example: `' OR 1=1--` (always true) vs `' OR 1=2--` (always false)

**3. Time-Based Blind SQL Injection**
- Uses database functions that cause delays to infer information
- Example: `'; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'--`

#### Common SQL Injection Payloads:
```sql
' OR '1'='1
'; DROP TABLE users; --
' UNION SELECT password FROM users --
' AND SLEEP(5) --
admin'--
```
